If by the act the perpetrator enriched, or tried to enrich himself, then a fine, which otherwise would have been inapplicable or only optional, may be imposed collateral to imprisonment, if it is appropriate, taking into consideration the personal and financial circumstances of the perpetrator. This shall not apply if the court imposes a property fine pursuant to Section 43a.
