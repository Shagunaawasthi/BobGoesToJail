To the extent that the forfeiture of a particular object is impossible due to the nature of what was acquired or for some other reason or because forfeiture of a replacement object pursuant to Section 73 subsection (2), sent. 2, has not been ordered, the court shall order the forfeiture of a sum of money which corresponds to the value of that which was acquired. The court shall also make such an order collateral to the forfeiture of an object to the extent its value falls short of the value of that which was originally acquired.
