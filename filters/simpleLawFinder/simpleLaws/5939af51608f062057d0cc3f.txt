In the case of acts committed reciprocally which are connected with one another and may only be prosecuted upon complaint, if one entitled person has filed for criminal prosecution of the other, then the other's right to file a complaint is extinguished if he has not exercised it before the completion of his last word in the proceedings at first instance. He may still file the complaint even if, for him, the period for filing the complaint has expired.
