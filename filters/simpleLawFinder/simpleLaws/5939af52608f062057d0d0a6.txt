If the convicted person, due to his personal or financial circumstances, cannot be expected to pay the fine immediately, the court shall grant him a payment deadline or allow him to pay in specified instalments. The court may also order that the privilege of paying the fine in fixed instalments be withdrawn if the convicted person fails to pay an instalment in time.
