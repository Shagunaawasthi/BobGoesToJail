14 Acting for Another

(1) If someone acts:

1. as an entity authorized to represent a legal person or as a member of such an entity;

2. as a partner authorized to represent a commercial partnership; or

3. as a statutory representative of another,

then a law, according to which special personal attributes, relationships or circumstances (special personal characteristics) forms the basis of punishability, shall also be applicable to the representative, if these characteristics do not, in deed, pertain to him, but exist as to the person represented.

(2) If the owner of a business or someone otherwise so authorized:

1. commissions a person to manage a business, in whole or in part; or

2. expressly commissions a person to perform on his own responsibility duties which are incumbent on the owner of the business,

and if this person acts on the basis of this commission, then a law, according to which special personal characteristics are the basis of punishability shall also be applicable to the person commissioned, if these characteristics do not, indeed, pertain to him, but exist as to the owner of the business. Within the meaning of Sentence 1, an enterprise is the equivalent of a business. If someone acts on the basis of a corresponding commission for an agency which performs duties of public administration, then Sentence 1 (3) Subsections (1) and (2) shall also be applicable if the legal act which was intended to form the basis of the power of representation or the agency is void.
