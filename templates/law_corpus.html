 the detention for the purposes of incapacitation order would be 
disproportionate because the offender was not, in an overall evaluation

No 1,</p><p><a name="p0489"><!----></a>the court shall suspend the

 shall automatically lead to the person being subject to supervision.The

public authority shall not be credited to the period. The court shall 
order its enforcement if the purpose of the measure still so requires. 
If the purpose of the measure has not been achieved, yet special 
circumstances justify the expectation that it may be achieved by a 
suspension order, the court shall suspend the measure for an operational

detention. If a custodial measure is enforced before a sentence of 
imprisonment imposed at the same time, the maximum period shall be 
extended by the length of the term of imprisonment to the extent the 
time spent in the measure is credited towards the sentence.</p><p><a name="p0493"><!----></a>(2)
 If no maximum period has been provided or the period has not yet 
expired, the court shall suspend the measure for an operational 
probationary period if it can be expected that the person subject to the
 measure will not commitany more unlawful acts if released. The order 
for suspension shall automatically lead to the person being subjected to
 supervision. The same shall apply mutatis mutandis if the court, after 
enforcement of the incapacitation order has begun, finds that its 
further enforcement would be disproportionate, because the detainee was 
not offered sufficient care within the meaning of section 66c(1) No 1 
before a period set by the court not exceeding six months has elapsed; 
such a period shall be set by the court when reviewing the suspension of
 the enforcement, unless sufficient care is offered, indicating the 
measures to be offered. The suspension under the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> sentences shall automatically lead to the person being subject to supervision.</p><p><a name="p0494"><!----></a>(3)
 If ten years of an incapacitation order have been served, the court

resulting in serious emotional trauma or physical injury to the victims.
 The order for release shall automatically lead to the person being 
subject to supervision.</p><p><a name="p0495"><!----></a>(4) If the

 If, after the enforcement of a mental hospital order has begun, the

supervision if it can be expected that the person will not commit any 
further offences without it.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html#gl_p0498">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p0498"><!----></a>Section 67e<br>Review</p><p><a name="p0499"><!----></a>(1)

 If an unlawful act has been committed and the principal or a secondary

 to a claim of the victim the satisfaction of which would deprive the

obtained.</p><p><a name="p0644"><!----></a>(2) The order of confiscation
 shall extend to benefits derived from what was obtained. It may also 
extend to objects which the principal or secondary participant has

the assumption that these objects were acquired as a result of unlawful 
acts, or for the purpose of committing them. The 1st sentence shall also

 The counselling serves to protect unborn life. It should be guided by 
efforts to encourage the woman to continue the pregnancy and to open her
 to the prospects of a life with the child; it should help her to make a
 responsible and conscientious decision. The woman must thereby be aware
 that the unborn child has its own right to life with respect to her at 
every stage of the pregnancy and that a termination of pregnancy can 
therefore only be considered under the law in exceptional situations, 
when carrying the child to term would give rise to a burden for the 
woman which is so serious and extraordinary that it exceeds the 
reasonable limits of sacrifice. The counselling should, through advice 
and assistance, contribute to overcoming the conflict situation which 
exists in connection with the pregnancy and remedying an emergency 
situation. Further details shall be regulated by the Act on Pregnancies 
in Conflict Situations.</p><p><a name="p1843"><!----></a>(2) The 
counselling must take place pursuant to the Act on Pregnancies in 
Conflict Situations through a recognised pregnancy conflict counselling 
agency. After the conclusion of the counselling on the subject, the 
counselling agency must issue the pregnant woman with a certificate 
including the date of the last counselling session and the name of the 
pregnant woman in accordance with the Act on Pregnancies in Conflict 
Situations. The physician who performs the termination of pregnancy is

 Detention under a custodial addiction treatment order may not exceed a

for suspension shall automatically lead to the person being subjected to
 supervision. The same shall apply mutatis mutandis if the court, after 
enforcement of the incapacitation order has begun, finds that its 
further enforcement would be disproportionate, because the detainee was 
not offered sufficient care within the meaning of section 66c(1) No 1 
before a period set by the court not exceeding six months has elapsed; 
such a period shall be set by the court when reviewing the suspension of

 If a person has been convicted of an unlawful act he committed in

 Whosoever terminates a pregnancy in cases under section 218a(2) or (3) 
without having received the written determination of a physician, who 
did not himself perform the termination of the pregnancy, as to whether 
the conditions of section 218a(2) or (3) were met shall be liable to 
imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine unless the offence is

section 218a(2) or (3) for presentation under the 1st sentence above

 A physician must not make determinations pursuant to section 218a(2) or

has been convicted by final judgment for an unlawful act under 
subsection (1) or under section 218, section 219a or section 219b or for
 another unlawful act which he committed in connection with a 
termination of pregnancy. The competent agency may provisionally 
prohibit a physician from making determinations under section 218a(2)

 The counselling serves to protect unborn life. It should be guided by 
efforts to encourage the woman to continue the pregnancy and to open her
 to the prospects of a life with the child; it should help her to make a
 responsible and conscientious decision. The woman must thereby be aware
 that the unborn child has its own right to life with respect to her at 
every stage of the pregnancy and that a termination of pregnancy can 
therefore only be considered under the law in exceptional situations, 
when carrying the child to term would give rise to a burden for the 
woman which is so serious and extraordinary that it exceeds the 
reasonable limits of sacrifice. The counselling should, through advice 
and assistance, contribute to overcoming the conflict situation which 
exists in connection with the pregnancy and remedying an emergency 
situation. Further details shall be regulated by the Act on Pregnancies 
in Conflict Situations.</p><p><a name="p1843"><!----></a>(2) The 
counselling must take place pursuant to the Act on Pregnancies in 
Conflict Situations through a recognised pregnancy conflict counselling 
agency. After the conclusion of the counselling on the subject, the 
counselling agency must issue the pregnant woman with a certificate 
including the date of the last counselling session and the name of the 
pregnant woman in accordance with the Act on Pregnancies in Conflict 
Situations. The physician who performs the termination of pregnancy is 
excluded from being a counsellor.</p><p style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal"><a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html#gl_p1844">table of contents</a></p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold"><a name="p1844"><!----></a>Section 219a<br>Advertising services for abortion</p><p><a name="p1845"><!----></a>(1)
